  <h1 class="heading">My Year Summed Up In Pictures</h1>
  <p class="content">Woah you stuck around! On this page I have added three various images along with a very well written poem to show you my year. The first image is me in March right before lockdown happened. I went on a roadtrip and this picture was taken in New York City. Little did I know that this would be my last moment of freedom before the world shut down. The second image is a screenshot of one of my very first hate comments! I turned to creating content on social media during the pandemic to fill my time. I have received an overwhelming amount of support but along with that comes hate.</p>
